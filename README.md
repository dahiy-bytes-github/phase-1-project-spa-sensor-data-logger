# Sensor Data Management SPA

## Overview
The following is an SPA for sensor data entries management and visualization. The user will be able to create, read, update, and delete sensor records while sorting them without page reloads. The application will interact with a JSON server regarding the storage and retrieval of information. In this way, an efficient user interface to handle sensor data originating from environmental monitoring sensors is provided in a responsive manner.

## Project Description
The project, in a way, is one of those typical CRUD applications to process sensor readings, presumably from an environmental monitoring system. Every recording of sensor data involves type, value, and timestamp information. The app makes it easy to edit or remove records and handle the information efficiently.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new sensor data records, including sensor type, value, and timestamp.
- **Read**: View all saved sensor data, dynamically retrieved from a JSON server.
- **Update**: Edit existing sensor data entries with updated values.
- **Delete**: Remove specific entries directly from the list.
- **Sort**: Organize sensor data by attributes such as timestamp or value.
- **Responsive and Intuitive UI**: Easy-to-navigate layout with real-time interaction, powered by JavaScript event listeners.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and user interactions.
- **JSON Server**: For local data storage and API simulation.
